This is a simple clock that displays the current time brightly, and in large format. I want this to be a thin window that I can drag to the top of my desktop when I am showcalling to clearly see the current time. 
Although I use software like ontime and stagetimer.io, I like to have the current time displayed clearly on a reference monitor.

I wanted to start developing desktop apps with Electron with a simple project for learning and getting familiar, but also a practicle one that I will actually use.
